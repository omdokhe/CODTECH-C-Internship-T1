DESCRIPTION :

This repository contains the tasks completed during my CODTECH Internship Program. The internship focused on developing strong fundamentals in C programming through practical implementation of core computer science concepts such as file handling, linked lists, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques.

All tasks were implemented in C language with a modular and structured approach. The programs were tested using real input files and executed through the GCC compiler environment. These tasks helped me improve my understanding of system-level programming and problem-solving using C.

------------------------------------------------------------

Task 1: File Handling Program

The first task was to implement a file handling utility in C. The program demonstrates basic operations such as creating a file, writing data into a file, reading file contents, and appending new data to an existing file.

File handling is an essential concept in programming because it allows applications to store and retrieve information permanently. Many real-world applications depend on file processing for managing data.

Applications:
- Log file generation in software systems
- Report generation tools
- File-based data storage utilities
- Text processing applications

------------------------------------------------------------

Task 2: Linked List Implementation

The second task involved implementing a singly linked list with standard operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal. Linked lists are dynamic data structures that allow efficient memory usage compared to static arrays.

This task strengthened my understanding of pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and data structure design.

Applications:
- Implementation of stacks and queues
- Memory management in operating systems
- Real-time data handling systems
- Playlist or navigation systems

------------------------------------------------------------

Task 3: Lexical Analyzer (Compiler Design Basics)

The third task was based on compiler design fundamentals. A simple lexical analyzer was developed to identify tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, numbers, and special symbols from an input C source file.

Lexical analysis is the first stage of a compiler, where the source code is converted into tokens for further syntax and semantic processing.

Applications:
- Compiler and interpreter development
- Syntax highlighting in code editors
- Static code analysis tools
- Programming language processing systems

------------------------------------------------------------

Task 4: Data Compression Tool (Run Length Encoding)

The final task was to implement a basic data compression and decompression tool using the Run Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm.

The tool compresses a text file by replacing repeated characters with a character-count representation. It also supports decompression to restore the original file content.

Example:
Input:  AAAABBBCCDAA
Output: A4B3C2D1A2

Applications:
- Text compression utilities
- Data transmission optimization
- Storage reduction techniques
- Fundamentals of encoding algorithms

------------------------------------------------------------

Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and environment were used during the internship:

- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (MinGW-w64)
- IDE/Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Operating System: Windows 11 Pro
- Terminal: PowerShell Integrated Terminal
- Version Control Platform: GitHub

------------------------------------------------------------

Learning Outcome

Through these internship tasks, I gained practical experience in:

- File operations and persistence in C
- Dynamic data structures and pointer handling
- Compiler design basics and tokenization
- Implementation of compression algorithms
- Writing structured and modular C programs
