DESCRIPTION :

This task focuses on implementing a complete file handling program using the C programming language. File handling is one of the most important concepts in programming because it allows applications to store data permanently. Unlike variables, which store information temporarily during program execution, files help in saving data for future use. In this task, the program demonstrates the fundamental operations that can be performed on a text file, such as creating a file, writing content into it, reading the stored content, and appending additional data without deleting existing information.

The program is designed in a modular way, where separate functions are used for each file operation. This makes the code more structured, readable, and easier to maintain. The user is provided with a menu-driven interface, allowing them to select the required operation interactively. When the user chooses the write option, the program opens the file in write mode and stores the entered text. The read operation displays the contents of the file on the screen. The append operation opens the file in append mode and adds new data at the end of the file, preserving the previous content. Proper error handling is included to ensure that the program behaves safely if a file cannot be opened or accessed.

This task was implemented in the C programming language using standard library functions such as fopen(), fclose(), fgets(), fputs(), and fprintf(). These functions form the backbone of file input/output in C. The project was developed and executed on Windows 11 using Visual Studio Code as the editor. GCC compiler from MinGW-w64 was used to compile and run the program inside the VS Code terminal environment.

File handling programs like this are widely applicable in real-world software development. Many applications rely on file operations, such as maintaining logs in operating systems, saving user information in small-scale systems, generating reports, handling configuration files, and storing transaction data. Even large systems such as banking software, educational management systems, and hospital record systems depend heavily on file processing concepts at their core. Understanding these operations is essential for building reliable applications.

This task provides strong foundational knowledge for students and beginners to understand how data is stored, retrieved, and managed in external files. It also improves practical understanding of pointers, memory buffers, and file modes in C. Overall, this task is an important step toward mastering system-level programming and building more advanced applications.
